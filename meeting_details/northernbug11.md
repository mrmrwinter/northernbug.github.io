# What to expect

NorthernBUG meetings are open to anyone interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research. Meetings are free, and lunch is provided!

These meetings focus on being a user group for the benefit of all. Talks and posters do not have to be a polished and complete body of work, but can be an opportunity to discuss your research with others experienced in the area. There is always a friendly atmosphere, with discussions around techniques, training and education, as well as broader applied research areas.
